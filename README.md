You will need to add the WEBOTS_HOME variable to your environment variables for
CMake to find it. If you have not specified an installation directory, the
default path is `C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Webots`

Additionally, you will need to add the Webots controller and bin directories to
your PATH: `${WEBOTS_HOME}\lib\controller` and
`${WEBOTS_HOME}\msys64\mingw64\bin`
